These are the samples for Pentaho Data Integration.

Installation:
  Copy this project (or make a link) to data-integration/pdi-samples

Goals:
  Demonstrate functionality of job entries / transformation steps
  Provide a testable framework to verify PDI is working as expected

If you want to contribute any new or improved samples to help others understand and use PDI functionality, please do!

Rules:
  All Jobs / Transformations MUST have their shared objects file set to:
    ./pdi-samples/res/shared.xml

  All Jobs / Transformations MUST have a verfiable output

Plans:
  Sample database that is easily used and does not need to be installed
  HTML navigation with extra documentation




Job entries / transformation steps requiring special considerations:
  De-serialize from file:
    Need more information on how to use this step

  Email messages input:
    Needs valid POP3/IMAP configurations

  ESRI Shapefile Reader:
    Need more information and sample files

  Get repository names:
    Need to be connected to a repository for this to work
